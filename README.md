# Web Development In 2020 - A Practical Guide Courses
It's that time of year again, and Brad Traversy has released his Web Development roadmap for the upcoming year. It is a fantastic resource that I know we are all thankful for. And being a web developer has never been better, and as shown in the video there are a **TON** of technologies at our disposal! But, that can also be rather intimidating for newcomers. So I have comprised a list below of the top Udemy courses for each slide as well for other resources as much as possible. They will listed just in alphabetical order for simplicity. From here, it really is up to you what you want to learn. 

And as Brad mentions in the video, you certainly **DO NOT** need to learn everything here. He is just providing you with the options of what you *CAN* learn (and somethings you *SHOULD* learn, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and explains what these technologies are.

Watch the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pThnRneDjw).

And of course there are other learning platforms besides Udemy, but that is the platform I am personally most familiar and I think is the most popular, so that's what I am going with. So withour further ado, let's get learning!
